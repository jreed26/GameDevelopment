Game Development Experience:A Summary.

  My experience with Game Development came in the form of an assignment during a course centered around Software Engineering. The assignment was a group-style project that was designed to take place incrementally over the course of the entire semester. The coursework breakdown was implemented by way of 3 separate sprints, lasting 2 weeks each. At the end of each sprint we had to complete a sprint retrospective. The retrospective evaluated 4 main categories: 
1.	Deliverables Completed during the sprint.
2.	A personal evaluation on the progress made (or didnâ€™t make)
3.	An evaluation of problems/ and or potential problems that may arise.
4.	Items to complete during the next sprint.


The project was designed to allow us to implement an Agile Framework, while also giving exposure to software engineering concepts such as: MoSCoW, Gerkin Syntax, Gestalt Design Principles, Software Design and Requirements, and many other methodologies used in Creating Software. 
	The Application we developed was our choice, and by majority rule we decided on an adventure style videogame. In the group I focused mostly on Technical Design aspects, including elements such as:
	
	
1.	Game Engine
2.	Flow and Control Structure
3.	State Management
4.	Memory Management


This project also presented ample exposure to Git Bash, and Version Control. I also took this opportunity to expose myself to linux command line.

With respect to the project specifically, and not the goals of the project, I was able to design, implement, and integrate several design patterns. 
I was also able to expose myself to Gradle and building applications. I was also able to implement the methodologies and strategies we were being taught 
in near real time. This application of concept so quickly is not an experience I have had often so it was enlightening to be able to actively apply new material.
